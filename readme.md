#### What is this repo for?
This repo is the journey of learning rust. The two main resources I am learning
Rust from are:
- 1. [Rustling - Book (Brown edition with quizzes)](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu)  
- 2. [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)  

Taking clean and crisp notes along with code explanations is how I learn and
take notes.
