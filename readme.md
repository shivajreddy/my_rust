#### What is this repo for?
This repo is my journey of learning Rust. The two main resources I use are:  
- [Rustling - Book (Brown edition with quizzes)](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu)  
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)  

Taking clean and crisp notes along with code explanations is how I learn and
take notes.
