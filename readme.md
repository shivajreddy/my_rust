#### What is this repo for?
This repo is my journey into getting good at Rust.  
My goal as a programmer is to go deeper into topics and work on complex projects,  
and I want to do that by getting good at Rust.  
Making Rust as my primary language is my ultimate goal.  
So that I can think in Rust with out having to think in Rust.  


## Books I learn from (/books/)
**If you find this repo any helpful, please buy the books and support the authors. None of the links are referals** 
- [0. The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)  
- [1. Rustling - Book (Brown edition with quizzes)](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu)  
- [2. Programming Rust (O'Reilly 2nd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development-dp-1492052590/dp/1492052590)  
Not a personal favorite of writing style, but comparet to other books, covered a wide range  
of topics, with a very handful of examples.
Book is alright, not exteremely deep dive into the language, but it's a good manual.  
It is really helpful to have it handy, so recomended to get it.  
- [3. Rust for Rustaceans, Jon Gjengset](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans)
Writing style is deep, content is dense, the more deeper you follow the  
content from beginning the easier and more control  
you gain over the language. Hands down the best book for sincere rust programemrs.  
Follow along with Jon's YT series [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa)  

## Pracrice stuff I have found after extensive research (/practice/)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)  
An amazing site(really cool project), that has a handful of problems that you 
can do, which have decent tests, and also a cli to do the problems locally.  
Use this if you feel bored to spice things up. For non programemrs do not start here.  
For experienced devs who read the book, go for it.

Taking clean and crisp notes along with code explanations is how I learn and
take notes.
